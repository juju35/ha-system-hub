# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### New
- Repository set up: the System Hub integration (single entry), its CI and its icon.
- **Modules**: each feature is a module turned on or off in the setup and in **Configure → Modules**. A module turned off stops its checks, its entities and its device are removed and its actions refuse to run; its settings and saved state are kept.
- **Watchdog module** (from Integration Watchdog 1.10.0): reloads the integrations whose entities are all unavailable, power cycles devices through their smart plug, notifications, Repairs issue with **Try again**, history kept across restarts. Actions `system_hub.watchdog_check` and `system_hub.watchdog_reset`, events `system_hub_integration_reloaded` and `system_hub_device_power_cycled`.
- **Marketplace module** (from Marketplace Refresh 2.6.1): server-side check of the Marketplace updates at the interval chosen, installs on demand with an optional backup first. Actions `system_hub.marketplace_check_updates`, `marketplace_check_repository` and `marketplace_install_updates`, event `system_hub_marketplace_updates_found`.
- Diagnostics of every module turned on; 23 languages.
